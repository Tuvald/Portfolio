# Tuva Djupviks Portfolio 

## Description 
This website was created as part of my DECO7180 course, and is built to showcase my web design skills.

## Usage
Visit [my portfolio page](https://deco1800-6f70f6cd.uqcloud.net/) on the UQ cloud zone to explore my work.
NB: the cloud does not work anymore. Open the index.html in a browser of your choice instead. 

The website is on one page style, meaning that everything is on one page, and it will only load new pages if you click a button to view one of my projects or other links on my website. 

NB: The menu remembers the last place you clikced in the menu, meaning it does not react on
scrolling on the page. If you refresh the page, it does not remember where you where last, since it only remembers what happens within each session. 

NB: The "View project" button for the Safe Plate project is meant to take you to a website on the UQ cloud zone, but it has been shut down, and is therefore empty. 

## Technologies used:

- JavaScript
